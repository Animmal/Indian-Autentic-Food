<p>Indian food, though hugely popular, is highly misunderstood. It's easy to look at the country's cuisine and assume that it's always hot and spicy, or oily, rich, and fatty, so it's unhealthy and bad for your diet. When browsing recipes with their sometimes long lists of ingredients, you might even get the impression that cooking Indian dishes is difficult and time-consuming. All of these are misconceptions, though. Just like any other cuisine in the world, Indian food is diverse. You can find spicy recipes and pleasantly mild ones, complex dishes that take hours, and those that you can whip up within an hour. And, you don't even need curry powder. Don't go by hearsay and common opinion. Dive in and discover for yourself the amazing world of Indian cuisine. It is a journey you will never regret!<p>
